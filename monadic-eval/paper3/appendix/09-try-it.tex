\section{Try It Out}\label{s:try-it}

All of the components discussed in this paper have been implemented as
units~\cite{local:flatt-pldi98} in Racket~\cite{dvanhorn:plt-tr1}.  We have
also implemented a ⸨#lang⸩ language so that composing and experimenting with
these interpreters is easy.  Assuming Racket is installed, you can install the
⸨monadic-eval⸩ package with (URL redacted for double-blind).
%\begin{center}
%\begin{verbatim}
%raco pkg install https://github.com/plum-umd/monadic-eval.git
%\end{verbatim}
%\end{center}

%A ⸨#lang monadic-eval⸩ program starts with a list of components, which are
%linked together, and an expression producing an evaluator.  Subsequent forms
%are interpreted as expressions when run. Programs can be run from the
%command-line or interactively in the DrRacket IDE.
